#---------------------------  Problem Description  ----------------------------#
## 2n prisoners each have a unique prisoner number from 1 to 2n. The prison
## contains a room in which there are 2n boxes, each with a unique number from 1
## to 2n painted on its lid. 2n cards, each printed with a unique number from 1
## to 2n, are randomly placed one in each box. The prisoners have the task of
## finding the card with their number on it by opening a maximum on n boxes.
## After each prisoner’s go, the room is returned exactly to its original state
## and the prisoner is not allowed to communicate with prisoners yet to have
## their go. If all prisoners succeed in finding their number, then they all go
## free.
#--------------------------------   Task   ------------------------------------#
## We will estimate the probabilities of successfully finding the correct card,
## both for individual prisoners and for the whole group. We will follow and
## assess 3 strategies:
##
## 1) Each prisoner starts at the box with their number on it, opens it and
##    reads the number on the card: k, say. If k is not their prisoner number,
##    they go to box number k, open it and repeat the process until they have
##    either found the card with their number on it, or opened n boxes without
##    finding it.
##
## 2) Same as strategy 1, but starting from a randomly selected box.
##
## 3) They open n boxes at random, checking each card for their number.
##
## Additionally, we will estimate and plot the probabilities of each loop
## length, from 1 to 2n, occurring at least once in a random shuffling of cards
## to boxes. (A loop occurs when some card in the sequence of opened boxes
## has the number of the first box opened).
#------------------------  Theoretical expectations  --------------------------#
## First we will examine the individual probabilities.
##
##  For strategy 1, we can view the boxes as nodes of a graph, connected with
##  vertexes iff the card number of the first box is the number of the second
##  box.
##  e.g. 4[6] -> 6[1] -> 1[...], 4,6,1 are nodes, (4,6), (6,1) are vertexes.
##
##  This graph is always partitioned into disjoint cycles.
##
##  Cycles because when a prisoner opens a box, the only possible outcomes are
##  either 1) open a new box or 2) return to the initial box, since the cards
##  that lead to the other boxes in the cycle have already been found. Disjoint
##  because two different cards can't lead to the same box, nor can one card
##  lead to more (or less) than 1 boxes.
##
##  This way, the prisoner finds his card after opening less or equal to n
##  boxes, iff the cycle that contains his initial box choice has length smaller
##  than n.
##
##  The possible cycle outcomes for prisoner k are {k}U{A} where A is an element
##  of power_set({1,...,k-1,k+1,..2n}). Thus the sample space size is 2^(2n-1),
##  and exactly half of these samples result in the prisoner finding his card
##  (symmetry of the power set). Thus the probability of success should be 1/2.
##
##  For strategy number 2 the format is the same as strategy number 1, but this
##  time, it is possible for a prisoner to choose a cycle that doesn't contain
##  his number. Thus, we expect the probability to be lower compared to
##  strategy number 1.
##
##  With strategy number 3, using simple combination theory, we can derive that
##  the probability of success is 1/2.
##
## If we consider 2n random variables as the result of each prisoners attempt
## (success or failure), then with strategies number 2 and 3 these random
## variables would be i.i.d. This means that the probability of everyone
## finding his card would be the product of the individual probabilities. As n
## increases, this probability decreases exponentially.
##
## With strategy 1 however, if prisoner k succeeds, every prisoner that begins
## with a box of the same cycle as prisoner k will succeed. This means that the
## variables are not independent. The result of the arithmetical approximation
## of the probability of success in this case, is very impressive!
