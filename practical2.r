#-----------------------      Problem Description   ---------------------------#
# 
# 2n prisoners each have a unique prisoner number from 1 to 2n. The prison contains
# a room in which there are 2n boxes, each with a unique number from 1 to 2n painted
# on its lid. 2n cards, each printed with a unique number from 1 to 2n, are randomly
# placed one in each box. The prisoners have the task of finding the card with their 
# number on it by opening a maximum on n boxes. After each prisonerâ€™s go, the room
# is returned exactly to its original state and the prisoner is not allowed to
# communicate with prisoners yet to have their go. If all prisoners succeed in
# finding their number, then they all go free.
